Hello! This is a collection of gaming projects using OpenGl API

You probably won't be able to run the programs without doing a few weird things with Visual Studio's paths and linker and yadayada. But, you can view the main.cpp files and get a gist of the project and look at an attached video to understand what it does. The main.cpp file is located within the SDL Simple folder within each project.
