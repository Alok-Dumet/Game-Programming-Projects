Hello! This is a collection of gaming projects using OpenGl API

You probably won't be able to run the programs without doing a few weird things with Visual Studio's paths and linker and yadayada. But, you can view the main.cpp files and get a gist of the project and look at an attached video to understand what it does\

1. Project 1 is a test of object translation and rotation using Ace Attourney characters by Capcom

2. Project 2 is a cool version of Pong that uses Captain Falcon and a Smash Ball by Nintendo
